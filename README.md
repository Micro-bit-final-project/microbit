## Micro:bit
In this repository are stored the necessary files to compile the joystick software for the micro:bit.

### Set up
In order to be able to compile the code locally you need to follow the [Offline development tutorial](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/offline-toolchains/) provided by the [University of Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/).

### Repo structure
* [main.cpp](https://github.com/Micro-bit-final-project/microbit/blob/master/source/main.cpp): Currently used as a test software to check that the Micro:bit can both send and receive through UART.

### How to check if the Micro:bit is working
To check that an UART communication between the Micro:bit and the computer can be established and maintained, please refer to our [Micro:bit Test Unit](https://github.com/Micro-bit-final-project/microbit_test_unit).
